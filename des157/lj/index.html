            <h2>Form Design Practices to Make Your Form Not Suck</h2>
            <h3>January 21st, 2021</h3>
            <p>
                From personal experience, forms are a usability nightmare. They either are confusing to follow or annoying to use. I never realized how many aspects of the form designers have to consider when designing a form until reading this article. It seems that a lot of the best practices have to do with handling errors, creating a smooth user flow, and improving the functionality/usability of the form. As I was reading the article, I realized that I overlook many of these design choices used in forms that I may use everyday. For example, the fact that inline labels are typically only used for search bars or straightforward fields for usernames and passwords. A design choice as simple as where the labels are located has a big impact on how the user interacts with the form. All these practices that this article discusses are things I find important to know as a designer and will definitely take into consideration when designing forms in the future. <br>
                <br>
                Things I will focus on when designing forms is having a minimal design that allows users to quickly understand what is being asked of them, like having a one column layout and having labels positioned above the input fields. As for more general practices, I will use colors to make forms more accessible, such as having good contrasting colors that make it easy to read.
