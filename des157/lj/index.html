            <h2>Best Modal Window Design Practices</h2>
            <h3>January 28th, 2021</h3>
            <p>
                Prior to reading the article, “Best practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows,” I typically associated modal windows with being used for annoying pop-ups that you see right when you arrive on a webpage or when you are about to leave a webpage. It was interesting to see that modal windows could be used for functional purposes like composing a new tweet on Twitter or to be used for logging in to your account. I think I am so used to modal windows being annoying that I forget that they can be useful. The points the article discussed about the anatomy of a modal window made me realize designing for accessibility is important when it comes to modal windows. Allowing users to not only be able to press a cancel button to close a modal, but also have keyboard accessible control is essential. This way keyboard users can easily have access to the content and different fields within the overlay. This is similar to when designing a form. It is important to take into account that some users will use the “Tab” key to go from one field to the next. Having clearly labeled buttons that lead to modals that match what the label said is key because you don’t want your users to be surprised with irrelevant content. If designed correctly, modals can positively add to the user experience.

            <h2>Form Design Practices to Make Your Form Not Suck</h2>
            <h3>January 21st, 2021</h3>
            <p>
                From personal experience, forms are a usability nightmare. They either are confusing to follow or annoying to use. I never realized how many aspects of the form designers have to consider when designing a form until reading this article. It seems that a lot of the best practices have to do with handling errors, creating a smooth user flow, and improving the functionality/usability of the form. As I was reading the article, I realized that I overlook many of these design choices used in forms that I may use everyday. For example, the fact that inline labels are typically only used for search bars or straightforward fields for usernames and passwords. A design choice as simple as where the labels are located has a big impact on how the user interacts with the form. All these practices that this article discusses are things I find important to know as a designer and will definitely take into consideration when designing forms in the future. <br>
                <br>
                Things I will focus on when designing forms is having a minimal design that allows users to quickly understand what is being asked of them, like having a one column layout and having labels positioned above the input fields. As for more general practices, I will use colors to make forms more accessible, such as having good contrasting colors that make it easy to read.
